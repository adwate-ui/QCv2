# ============================================================================
# CLOUDFLARE PAGES CONFIGURATION (Root)
# ============================================================================
# This wrangler.toml is used ONLY when deploying via Cloudflare Pages dashboard
# with a custom deploy command set to "npx wrangler deploy".
#
# This is a FALLBACK configuration. The PRIMARY deployment method is:
#   → GitHub Actions using cloudflare/pages-action@v1
#   → See: .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
#
# Purpose:
#   • Allows Cloudflare Pages dashboard deployments to work
#   • Provides the required configuration file so wrangler doesn't fail
#   • The dashboard deploy command should ideally be REMOVED
#   • This file enables deployment to work if the command is present
#
# CRITICAL: Name MUST be "qcv2" (Pages project name)
# DO NOT use "authentiqc-worker" (that's the worker name)
#
# NOTE: This configuration is for wrangler to deploy static assets.
#       The actual Pages deployment is handled by GitHub Actions.
# ============================================================================

name = "qcv2"
compatibility_date = "2025-12-10"

# Static assets configuration for Pages deployment
assets = { directory = "pages/dist" }

# ============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT SEPARATION
# ============================================================================
#
# This configuration deploys to:
#   → Pages project: "qcv2"
#   → URL: https://qcv2.pages.dev
#
# The worker has its own separate configuration:
#   → File: workers/image-proxy/wrangler.toml
#   → Worker name: "authentiqc-worker"
#   → URL: https://authentiqc-worker.adwate.workers.dev
#
# Different names ensure deployments are independent and don't overwrite each other.
