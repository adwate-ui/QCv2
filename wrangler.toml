# ============================================================================
# CLOUDFLARE PAGES CONFIGURATION (Frontend Static Assets)
# ============================================================================
# This wrangler.toml is for deploying the Pages project (frontend assets)
# It is used ONLY when Cloudflare Pages executes "npx wrangler deploy"
# from the dashboard deploy command.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - This configuration deploys ASSETS (static files from dist/)
# - It does NOT deploy a Worker (no JavaScript code)
# - Worker deployment is handled separately in cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml
#
# Deployment Methods:
# 1. PRIMARY: GitHub Actions via cloudflare/pages-action@v1 (recommended)
# 2. FALLBACK: Cloudflare Pages dashboard deploy command (uses this config)
#
# DO NOT change the name from "qcv2" - it must match the Pages project name
# ============================================================================

name = "qcv2"
compatibility_date = "2025-12-10"
workers_dev = false

# Pages Assets Configuration
# This tells wrangler to deploy static assets from the dist directory
[assets]
directory = "./dist"

# Ensure this doesn't conflict with the worker deployment
# The authentiqc-worker is deployed separately from cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml
