# CLOUDFLARE PAGES CONFIGURATION (Frontend Static Assets ONLY)
# ============================================================================
# This wrangler.toml exists ONLY as a fallback for Cloudflare Pages dashboard
# deploy commands that cannot be removed.
#
# IMPORTANT - DEPLOYMENT SEPARATION:
# • This config is for PAGES assets only (name = "qcv2")
# • Worker has its own separate config (name = "authentiqc-worker")
# • These names MUST remain different to prevent conflicts
# • Primary deployment method is GitHub Actions (not dashboard)
#
# DO NOT change the name from "qcv2" - it must match the Pages project name
# and MUST be different from the worker name "authentiqc-worker"
# ============================================================================

# Pages Assets Configuration
# This tells wrangler to deploy static assets from the dist directory
# This is a Pages deployment, NOT a Worker deployment

# CRITICAL: This deploys to Pages project "qcv2", not to Workers
# Worker deployment uses cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml separately
