#   cd cloudflare-worker
#   npx wrangler@4 deploy index.mjs --name authentiqc-worker

# For production (Cloudflare Pages):
#   Set VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL as a GitHub secret in your repository
#   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret)
#
# Leave empty if you don't have a worker deployed yet
# The app will work but image fetching from URLs will be disabled
