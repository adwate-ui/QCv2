# Gemini API Key (required for product identification and QC analysis)
# Get your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# For production deployment: Set as GitHub secret named GEMINI_API_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Cloudflare Worker URL for image proxy (required for fetching images from product URLs)
# ⚠️ NOTE: The application automatically normalizes this URL, so both formats work:
# ✅ https://authentiqc-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev (recommended)
# ✅ https://authentiqc-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/fetch-metadata (also works)
# 
# The app will automatically remove endpoint paths and construct the proper URLs
# 
# To deploy the worker:
#   cd cloudflare-worker
#   npx wrangler@4 deploy index.mjs --name authentiqc-worker
#
# For local development:
#   1. Copy this file to .env.local
#   2. Set your worker URL below (base URL recommended)
#   3. Restart dev server: npm run dev
#
# For production (Cloudflare Pages):
#   Set VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL as a GitHub secret in your repository
#   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret)
#
# See VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions
#
# Leave empty if you don't have a worker deployed yet
# The app will work but image fetching from URLs will be disabled
VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL=

# Supabase Configuration (defaults are pre-configured, override if needed)
# The app uses a shared Supabase account by default:
# - Project URL: https://gbsgkvmjtsjpmjrpupma.supabase.co
# - Anon Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imdic2drdm1qdHNqcG1qcnB1cG1hIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjUwOTQ4MjQsImV4cCI6MjA4MDY3MDgyNH0.GYsoEO8qJXOsiOjK2QHYMOOI0OFAdc9KqX1SA-Z-3ac
#
# Only set these if you want to use a different Supabase project:
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# 1. Copy this file and save it as .env.local (in the same directory)
# 2. Fill in your actual values above
# 3. Restart the dev server: npm run dev
# 4. .env.local is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository
