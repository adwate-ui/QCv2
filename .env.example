# Cloudflare Worker URL for image proxy (required for fetching images from product URLs)
# ⚠️ NOTE: The application automatically normalizes this URL, so both formats work:
# ✅ https://authentiqc-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev (recommended)
# ✅ https://authentiqc-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/fetch-metadata (also works)
# 
# The app will automatically remove endpoint paths and construct the proper URLs
# 
# To deploy the worker:
#   cd cloudflare-worker
#   npx wrangler@4 deploy index.mjs --name authentiqc-worker
#
# For local development:
#   1. Copy this file to .env.local
#   2. Set your worker URL below (base URL recommended)
#   3. Restart dev server: npm run dev
#
# For production (Cloudflare Pages):
#   Set VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL as a GitHub secret in your repository
#   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret)
#
# See VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions
#
# Leave empty if you don't have a worker deployed yet
# The app will work but image fetching from URLs will be disabled
VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL=

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# 1. Copy this file and save it as .env.local (in the same directory)
# 2. Fill in your actual values above
# 3. Restart the dev server: npm run dev
# 4. .env.local is gitignored and will not be committed to the repository
