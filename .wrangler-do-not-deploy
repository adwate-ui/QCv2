# DO NOT DEPLOY WORKER FROM ROOT DIRECTORY
# ============================================================================
#
# This file serves as a safeguard to prevent accidental worker deployments
# from the repository root.
#
# ❌ ERROR: If you're seeing this, wrangler was invoked from the wrong location!
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The Cloudflare Worker MUST be deployed from the cloudflare-worker/ directory
# - Pages deployment is handled by GitHub Actions, NOT by wrangler
# - If you see "Missing entry-point to Worker script" error, this is why!
#
# ============================================================================
# CORRECT DEPLOYMENT METHODS:
# ============================================================================
#
# FOR PAGES (Frontend):
#   - Deployment: Automatic via GitHub Actions
#   - Workflow: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
#   - Method: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
#   - NO wrangler command needed
#   - NO deploy command in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
#
# FOR WORKER (Image Proxy API):
#   - Deployment: Automatic via GitHub Actions
#   - Workflow: .github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml
#   - Manual: cd cloudflare-worker && npx wrangler@4 deploy
#   - Config: cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml
#
# ============================================================================
# CLOUDFLARE PAGES DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION:
# ============================================================================
#
# If you're seeing this error during Cloudflare Pages build, it means you have
# a custom "deploy command" configured in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
#
# TO FIX:
# 1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → qcv2
# 2. Go to Settings → Builds & deployments
# 3. Find "Build configurations" section
# 4. Look for "Deploy command" field
# 5. If it shows "npx wrangler deploy" or similar, DELETE IT
# 6. Leave the field EMPTY
# 7. Save settings
# 8. Retry deployment
#
# WHY:
# - GitHub Actions handles deployment automatically
# - Custom deploy commands are not needed
# - The deploy command runs from root where there's no wrangler config
# - This causes the "Missing entry-point" error
#
# ============================================================================
# BUILD CONFIGURATION (Cloudflare Pages Dashboard):
# ============================================================================
#
# ✅ CORRECT SETTINGS:
#   Build command:              npm run build
#   Build output directory:     dist
#   Deploy command:             (LEAVE EMPTY)
#   Root directory:             /
