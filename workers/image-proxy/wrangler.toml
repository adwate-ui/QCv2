# CLOUDFLARE WORKER CONFIGURATION (Image Proxy API)
# ============================================================================
# This wrangler.toml is ONLY for deploying the worker (API endpoints)
# It is NOT used for Pages deployment (that uses root wrangler.jsonc)
#
# DO NOT change the name from "authentiqc-worker" - the frontend expects this URL
#
# Deployment:
#   - Worker name: authentiqc-worker
#   - Worker URL: https://authentiqc-worker.adwate.workers.dev
#   - GitHub Actions: .github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml
#   - Manual deploy: cd cloudflare-worker && npx wrangler@4 deploy
#
# The frontend (Pages) uses VITE_IMAGE_PROXY_URL to connect to this worker

# Account ID is automatically detected from the CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
# Or can be set via CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable
# Do NOT hardcode the account_id here as it may cause conflicts if the token
# belongs to a different account or if deploying to multiple accounts

# Deployment Configuration
# GitHub integration is handled by GitHub Actions workflows
# This worker is deployed independently from the Pages project
